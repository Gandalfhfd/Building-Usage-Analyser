If Trevor is reading this, my apologies for including your code in my work.
It's amazing and I include it in the public repo so that my programme still works
if pulled from GitHub. If you want me to remove it from my public repo, please let
me know, I'll be happy to do so! If you want me to put a copyright notice in for you,
I can also do that.
